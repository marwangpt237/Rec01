# OSINT Face Recognition App - Todo List

## Phase 1: Set up Flask project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create Flask app using manus-create-flask-app
- [x] Update requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- [x] Install build dependencies (cmake, build-essential)
- [x] Install Python dependencies (using OpenCV instead of face_recognition)
- [x] Create project directory structure for face matching
- [x] Set up basic Flask routes

## Phase 2: Implement facial recognition and matching functionality
- [x] Create face detection and encoding functions
- [x] Implement face matching algorithm
- [x] Create database/folder structure for known faces
- [x] Add confidence scoring system

## Phase 3: Develop web interface with responsive design
- [x] Create HTML template with upload functionality
- [x] Add webcam capture capability
- [x] Design responsive CSS layout
- [x] Implement JavaScript for file handling

## Phase 4: Integrate OSINT APIs for public data lookup
- [x] Implement Gravatar API integration
- [x] Add GitHub Avatar API lookup
- [x] Integrate reverse image search capability
- [x] Add toggle for offline mode

## Phase 5: Create sample dataset and test the application
- [x] Generate/collect sample face images
- [x] Test face matching functionality
- [x] Test OSINT API integrations
- [x] Add threat level meter

## Phase 6: Prepare deployment configuration and documentation
- [x] Create deployment files (Procfile, runtime.txt)
- [x] Update requirements.txt with final dependencies
- [x] Write comprehensive README
- [x] Add security disclaimers

## Phase 7: Deploy and deliver the application to user
- [x] Test application locally
- [x] Attempt deployment (OpenCV compatibility issues in cloud environment)
- [x] Provide deployment URL and documentation
